I am a motivated and hard-working dev currently looking for employment following my 16 week Makers.com coding bootcamp. 

In the past months I've been developing my React.js and CSS knowledge. I soon hope to start learning Typescript and Python. 

Having made a few full stack sites I'm now working on personal web projects. Following some good advice, these projects will be gaming focused as games give unique logical and style challenges to overcome.  

**Tech Skills** : JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Express, Jest, Cypress, HTML, SCSS, CSS, Ruby, Sinatra, RSpec
