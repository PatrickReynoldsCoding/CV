I am a dedicated developer with a passion for building apps and websites. 

Recently completing a 16-week coding Bootcamp at Makers.com, I am now seeking employment opportunities to further advance my skills and portfolio.

 I am particularly focused on expanding my knowledge of design principles and exploring new and exciting areas of development. My recent project involved working with deployment, GO, React.js, and CSS. I am currently working on a number of personal projects, including a React memory game and about to start a collaborative project with a friend who asked for my help to create an interactive story-driven 8-bit game.

### Remap (Charity) / Volunteer(maker)
Being able to collaborate with fellow makers and designers has been a pure joy and being able to lead projects that have aided our disabled users has been beyond rewarding and raised both my confidence and devotion to my work.
In my time there, I have been able to explore areas I had little or no expertise such as;   Digital Sculpting, 3D Printing, 3D Object Mapping and hands-on product manufacture.
